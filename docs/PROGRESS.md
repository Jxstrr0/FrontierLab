## Session log

### 2026-10-24 — Stage 0 complete
- **Date:** 2026-10-24
- **Stage / step:** 0 — Scaffold and deploy
- **Done:**
  - Added all design docs to the repo (README and CLAUDE.md at the root, the rest in `docs/`).
  - Vite 8 + TypeScript (strict) + Preact + @preact/signals project, ESLint + Prettier, Vitest with sample tests.
  - `tokens.css` with the Banknote Deco palette, type scale and safe-area insets; Bodoni Moda and Public Sans bundled via @fontsource.
  - Title screen: engraved "Vault Street" wordmark over a procedural guilloche rosette (`src/art/guilloche.ts`), disabled New game / Continue, version string, "A Longlight Interactive game".
  - `src/config/balance.ts` with one `FEATURES` flag per roadmap stage.
  - GitHub Actions workflow: lint, test and build on every push and pull request; deploy to Pages on pushes to `main`.
  - Checked at 390×844 and 1280×800 in Chromium, served from a `/VaultStreet/` sub-path: fonts load, no console errors.
- **Decisions** (also in DESIGN §7):
  - Code goes straight to `main` (owner's choice); every push must be green.
  - Toolchain: Preact 10.29 rather than the 3-week-old Preact 11; TypeScript 6.0 because typescript-eslint doesn't support TypeScript 7 yet.
  - An ESLint rule blocks `Math.random`, `Date.now`, `window`, `document` and `localStorage` inside `src/sim/`, enforcing the pure-simulation rule automatically.
- **Doc ambiguities noticed** (none blocking; resolve as each stage arrives):
  - SCREENS §1 lists Continue / New Game / Load / Settings on the title; ROADMAP Stage 0 asks only for disabled New Game / Continue. Stage 0 shows those two; Load and Settings come with saves in Stage 2.
  - DEPLOYMENT's workflow runs only on `main`; it now also runs checks (without deploying) on pull requests.
- **Next:** Stage 1 — headless simulation core.
- **Known issues:** The owner must set Settings → Pages → Source to "GitHub Actions" once, or the deploy job fails.
